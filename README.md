# Javascript Timed Quiz

## Purpose

I was given a challenge to create a timed JavaScript quiz that would have a countdown. If the user answers a question incorrectly, it takes 5 seconds off the timer. The time left also accounts for the user score. If the time runs out or the user answers 10 questions total, it will allow them to enter their initials and take them to the high score screen. If their score is high enough to make it into the high scores list, their initials and score will be presented in the list. If they choose, they can erase the high scores and/or hit the back button to retake the quiz.
